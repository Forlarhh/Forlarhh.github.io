      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Ekiti State University, which laid the foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills. Currently, I am a DevOps and Platform Engineer at MTN, where I manage cloud infrastructure, automate deployment processes, and enhance platform scalability. My professional journey has equipped me with a robust skill set in IT and operations, with previous roles as a Technical Support Engineer at Consumer Links and a Service Operations Engineer at Seamfix. I’m passionate about optimizing processes, fostering team collaboration, and driving innovation in the tech space.</p>

  <p>I worked on a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline project using Azure DevOps. From automating builds to deploying code seamlessly.
    Some highlights:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automated Docker image creation and deployment</li>
    <li>Integrated with Kubernetes for smooth scaling</li>
    <li>Implemented Trivy scans for enhanced security during the build process</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h4>Complete CI/CD Devops Pipeline</h4>
        <p>I'm thrilled to showcase my recent project, which demonstrates the end-to-end process of automating the software development lifecycle from code integration to deployment and monitoring.

Here’s an overview of what I achieved:

-Set Up a Repository
-Configured Necessary Infrastructure
-Pushed Local Code to GitHub
-Built and Deployed the Application
-Monitored Application Performance
-Assigned a Custom Domain</p>
